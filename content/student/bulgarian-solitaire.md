# Bulgarian Solitaire

This question is about a city of skysrapers, like the one below:

Each *skyscraper* is a stack of a certain number of squares and, in a *city*, the skyscrapers are arranged in height order from left to right.

King Kong decides to rearrange the city. To do this, he removes the top block off of each skyscraper and uses the blocks that he has collected to build a new skyscraper. He finishes his new city by arranging the skyscrapers in height order from left to right.

He then decides to do this again.

He continues to repeat this process, generating a new city each time, until he builds a city which he has already seen. In our example, the fifth recontruction gives the same city as the first.

At this point, still dissatisfied, King Kong gives up.

# Tower of Hanoi

Three blocks are stacked in size order to form a tower, with the largest block at the base.

The blocks are positioned on the leftmost of three platforms.

Can you find a way to restack the blocks in the same order on the rightmost platform, following these rules?  
- You may only move one block at a time.
- A larger block can never be placed on top of a smaller block.

What is the smallest number of moves in which you can move the tower to the other platform?

What about if there are four blocks, or more?

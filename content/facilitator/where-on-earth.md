# Where on Earth?

## Introduction

The nice thing about this puzzle is that there are multiple answers which increase in obscurity. Usually students will find one particular answer first (or if they have heard the problem before, this is likely the solution that they will have seen), which is given in the Solution Section. This solution is a great example of how geometry is different on flat and curved surfaces, specifically that the sum of the angles in a triangle is more that 180 degrees on sphere.

In addition to this answer, there are others which are less obvious and students may need to be guided to find these solutions. These are given in the Extension Section.

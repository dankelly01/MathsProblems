# Speed, Distance, Time Riddles

## Introduction



## Solution

### Speed

One incorrect answer which is often given to this question is 45km/h, students having taken the average of 30 and 60, however the correct answer is actually 40km/h. What many people forget to consider is that, because both legs of the journey occur over the same distance, the bird is travelling at 30km/h for twice as long as it is travelling at 60km/h.   
Therefore the average speed for the whole journey must be closer to 30km/h than 60km/h. Specifically, it must be the average of 30, 30 and 60 (since each of these speeds are over the same time period) which is 40km/h.

If this is not clear, we can also do a calculation. Letting the distance between the nest and the tree be $d$,  

*Time for the first leg:* $t_1 = \frac{d}{30}$  
*Time for the second leg:* $t_2 = \frac{d}{60}$

*Total time:* $T = \frac{d}{30} + \frac{d}{60} = \frac{3d}{60} = \frac{d}{20}$

*Average speed:* $S = 2d \div \frac{d}{20} = 40$

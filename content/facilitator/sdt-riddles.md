# Speed, Distance, Time Riddles

## Introduction



## Solution

### Speed

An incorrect answer which is often given to this question is 45km/h, students having taken the average of 30 and 60, however the correct answer is actually 40km/h. What many people forget to consider is that, because both legs of the journey occur over the same distance, the bird is travelling at 30km/h for twice as long as it is travelling at 60km/h.   
Therefore the average speed for the whole journey must be closer to 30km/h than 60km/h. Specifically, it must be the average of 30, 30 and 60 (since each of these speeds are over the same time period) which is 40km/h.

If this is not clear, we can also do a calculation. Letting the distance between the nest and the tree be $d$,  

*Time for the first leg:* $t_1 = \frac{d}{30}$  
*Time for the second leg:* $t_2 = \frac{d}{60}$

*Total time:* $T = \frac{d}{30} + \frac{d}{60} = \frac{3d}{60} = \frac{d}{20}$

*Average speed:* $S = 2d \div \frac{d}{20} = 40$

### Distance

This question is probably the most challenging of the three. Students may immediately think 2 cars will be sufficient, one to drive across each half of the desert. The problem here is how do you get the second car to the half-way point without using any of its fuel (assuming you cannot tow it or use any other work arounds). Students may also think that the task is not possible, however it actually is with just 4 cars (and so four drivers too!).

Consider the case where you have two cars. You might begin by driving both cars a quarter of the way across the desert at which point both would have a half tank of fuel remaining. Now you could transfer the all of the fuel into one car and drive another "half-desert distance" to reach three quarters of the way. At this point you would run out of fuel, and cars.

With three cars, you can follow a similar process and reach a maximum $\frac{11}{12}$ of the way across before you run out of fuel.  
*(I will leave the method to do this for you to find)*

Using four cars, you can drive all of them out a quarter of the way untill they all have a half tank remaining. You can then collect the fuel into two full tanks in two cars and travel the remaining three quarters of the way as we showed above in the case with two cars.
*(There is actually a slightly more complicated method using four cars which can get you slightly further than the end of the desert, $\frac{25}{24} of the distance required. I will also leave this for you to find if you wish)*

### Time

The common incorrect answer given to this question is 20 days. This is mainly down to students not reading the question carefully and in fact this question is designed to prompt an "instinctive answer" which is not correct (see Extension section for more details). The correct answer to this question is, of course, 11 days since if the lake is half full on the 10th day, it will double in ammount to be completely full on the 11th.
